      content="Gravyn is a project management and collaboration Work OS that unifies planning, execution, client collaboration, and finance in one AI‑assisted workspace. It centralizes timelines, tasks, issues, milestones, messages, files, and scheduling alongside contracts, invoices, budgets, burn, variance, and forecast, so delivery and spending stay aligned in real time. Built‑in AI (Kairo, DriftIQ, AITriage) reads live work and cost signals to predict slippage and overruns early, auto‑generate clear status and client‑ready updates, and route intake to the right owner with priority and due dates—reducing handoffs, chasing, and manual reporting. Every change—moving a milestone, approving a change order, logging an issue—instantly updates forecasts and dashboards, giving leaders a single source of truth to ship on time and on budget with fewer tools and fewer meetings."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
